Problem 1: A bird is flying with a speed of 18.0 m/s over water when it accidentally drops a 2.00 kg fish. If the altitude of the bird is 5.40 m, what is the speed of the fish when it hits the water? Ignore air resistance.

(a) Player 1 : Draw a reference frame
(b) Player 2 : Define a net work/energy equation for the system
(c) Player 3:  Change in System Work
(d) Final Velocity Calculation:

Use the conservation of energy equation from step (b).
Plug in the known values.
Solve for the final velocity of the fish just before it hits the water.
Make sure to include units!
