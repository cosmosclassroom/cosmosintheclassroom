## Problem 1: Roller Coaster

A roller coaster car with a mass of 500 kg starts from rest at point A, which is 100 meters above the ground. It descends a curved track to point B, which is 20 meters above the ground. At point B, the car enters a loop-the-loop with a radius of 15 meters. After completing the loop, the car reaches point C, which is 50 meters above the ground. Finally, the car reaches point D, located on the ground. Assume negligible friction for the first three chunks, and consider a constant frictional force of 1000 N between C and D.

**(b) Net Force and Work Equations:** Define the net force and work equations for each segment of the track, considering gravity and friction where applicable.
**(c) Change in System Work:** Calculate the change in the system's work between points A and B, B and C, and C and D.
**(d) Final Velocity at D:** Determine the velocity of the car at point D.

## Problem 2: Pendulum and Block

A pendulum with a mass of 2 kg is released from rest at an angle of 60 degrees with the vertical. The length of the pendulum string is 3 meters. At the bottom of its swing, the pendulum collides elastically with a 1 kg block resting on a horizontal surface. The block then slides up an inclined plane with an angle of 30 degrees. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the plane is 0.2.
## Problem 2: Chunks

**(a) Diagram:** Draw a diagram of the pendulum's swing and the block's motion on the inclined plane.
**(b) Net Force and Work Equations:** Define the net force and work equations for the pendulum's swing, the collision, and the block's motion up the incline.
**(c) Change in System Work:** Calculate the change in the system's work during the pendulum's swing and the block's motion up the incline.
**(d) Distance Block Slides Up Incline:** Determine how far the block slides up the inclined plane.

## Problem 3: Inclined Plane and Spring

A 2 kg block is initially at rest at the top of an inclined plane that makes an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. The block slides down the plane, which has a length of 5 meters, and collides with a spring at the bottom. The spring has a spring constant of 300 N/m. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the plane is 0.1.

## Problem 3: Chunks

**(a) Diagram:** Draw a diagram of the inclined plane and the spring system.
**(b) Net Force and Work Equations:** Define the net force and work equations for the block's motion down the plane and the compression of the spring.
**(c) Change in System Work:** Calculate the change in the system's work during the block's slide down the plane and the compression of the spring.
**(d) Spring Compression:** Determine how much the spring is compressed when the block comes to a stop.

## Problem 4: Projectile Explosion

A 10 kg projectile is launched vertically upwards with an initial velocity of 50 m/s. At its maximum height, an internal explosion breaks the projectile into two fragments. One fragment, with a mass of 4 kg, falls straight down. The air resistance on the projectile during its ascent is negligible. The explosion releases 2000 J of energy.

**(a) Diagram:** Draw a diagram of the projectile's ascent and the explosion at its maximum height.
**(b) Net Force and Work Equations:** Define the net force and work equations for the projectile's ascent and the motion of the fragments after the explosion.
**(c) Change in System Work:** Calculate the change in the system's work during the projectile's ascent and the explosion.
**(d) Velocity of 6kg Fragment:** Determine the velocity of the 6 kg fragment immediately after the explosion.
