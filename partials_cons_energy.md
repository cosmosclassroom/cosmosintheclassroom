# Energy Problems

## Problem 1: Roller Coaster

A roller coaster car with a mass of 500 kg starts from rest at point A, which is 100 meters above the ground. It descends a curved track to point B, which is 20 meters above the ground. At point B, the car enters a loop-the-loop with a radius of 15 meters. After completing the loop, the car reaches point C, which is 50 meters above the ground. Finally, the car reaches point D, located on the ground. Assume negligible friction for the first three chunks, and consider a constant frictional force of 1000 N between C and D.

## Problem 1: Chunks

1.  What is the potential energy of the car at point A?
2.  What is the kinetic energy of the car at point B?
3.  What is the minimum speed of the car at the top of the loop-the-loop?
4.  What is the speed of the car at point D?

## Problem 2: Pendulum and Block

A pendulum with a mass of 2 kg is released from rest at an angle of 60 degrees with the vertical. The length of the pendulum string is 3 meters. At the bottom of its swing, the pendulum collides elastically with a 1 kg block resting on a horizontal surface. The block then slides up an inclined plane with an angle of 30 degrees. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the plane is 0.2.

## Problem 2: Chunks

1.  What is the potential energy of the pendulum at the initial position?
2.  What is the velocity of the pendulum just before the collision?
3.  What is the velocity of the block just after the collision?
4.  How far up the inclined plane does the block slide?

## Problem 3: Spring and Ramp

A spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m is compressed by 0.5 meters. A 3 kg block is placed against the spring and released. The block then travels along a horizontal surface and up a ramp that has a curve, then a straight incline. The horizontal surface has a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.1, and the ramp has no friction. The curve has a radius of 2 meters, and the incline reaches a vertical height of 1 meter.

## Problem 3: Chunks

1.  What is the elastic potential energy stored in the spring?
2.  What is the velocity of the block just as it leaves the spring?
3.  What is the velocity of the block at the top of the curved ramp?
4.  What is the velocity of the block at the top of the incline?

## Problem 4: Projectile Explosion

A 10 kg projectile is launched vertically upwards with an initial velocity of 50 m/s. At its maximum height, an internal explosion breaks the projectile into two fragments. One fragment, with a mass of 4 kg, falls straight down. The air resistance on the projectile during its ascent is negligible. The explosion releases 2000 J of energy.

## Problem 4: Chunks

1.  What is the maximum height reached by the projectile before the explosion?
2.  What is the velocity of the 6 kg fragment immediately after the explosion?
3.  What is the kinetic energy of the 4 kg fragment right before hitting the ground?
4.  What is the total mechanical energy of the system when the 6kg fragment is 10 m above the ground?
