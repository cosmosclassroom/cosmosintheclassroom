### Problem 4: A 1.0 x 10^3 kg elevator carries a maximum load of 800.0 kg. A constant frictional force of 4.0 x 10^3 N reduces the elevator’s upward motion. What minimum power, in kilowatts, must the motor deliver to lift the fully-loaded elevator at a constant speed of 3.0 m/s?

(a) Diagram:

Draw a diagram of the elevator and its load.
Indicate the direction of motion and the forces acting on the elevator.
Include the given information:
Mass of the elevator = 1.0 x 10^3 kg
Mass of the load = 800.0 kg
Frictional force = 4.0 x 10^3 N
Constant speed = 3.0 m/s
(b) Net Force and Work Equations:

Since the elevator moves at a constant speed, what is the net force?
Identify all the forces acting on the elevator (motor force, gravity, friction).
Write an expression for the net force.
Write the formula for the force of gravity.
Write the formula for power in terms of force and velocity.
(c) Change in System Work:

Explain that the motor must do work against gravity and friction.
(d) Minimum Power Calculation:

Calculate the total weight of the elevator and the load.
Determine the force that the motor must exert to lift the elevator at a constant speed (equal to the sum of the gravitational force and friction).
Calculate the minimum power required by the motor.
Convert the power to kilowatts.
Include units!
