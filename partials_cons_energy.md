### Problem 1: A bird is flying with a speed of 18.0 m/s over water when it accidentally drops a 2.00 kg fish. If the altitude of the bird is 5.40 m, what is the speed of the fish when it hits the water? Ignore air resistance.
- (a) Player 1 : Draw a reference frame
- (b) Player 2 : Define a net work/energy equation for the system
- (c) Player 3 : How will the energies in this system change from beginning to end?
- (d) Player 4: Determine the Final Velocity when the bird hits the water
  <details>
    The velocity is 20.7 m/s

### Problem 2: A diver weighing 755 N drops from a board 10.0 m above the water’s surface.

- (a) Player 1: Define a reference frame
- (b) Player 2: Write a net work/energy equation for the system
- (c) Player 3: Find the diver’s speed 5.00 m above the surface of the water.
- (d) Player 4: Calculate the velocity at the moment the diver hits the water.

  <details>
    The velocity at 5.0 m is 9.9 m/s
    The final velocity before striking the water is 14.0 m/s
  </details>

### Problem 3: A car with mass $1.50 x 10^3 kg$ starts from rest and accelerates to a speed of 18.0 m/s in 12.0 s. During its acceleration, the car covers a distance of 108 m. Assume the net frictional force (friction + air resistance) is a constant 400.0 N during this time.

- (a) Player 1: Draw a reference frame
- (b) Player 2: Write a Net Force / Net work / Net Energy Equation
- (c) Player 3: Determine the work done by friction
- (d) Player 4: determine the work done by the car

  <details>
    The work done by friction is $43/,200 J$ = $4.32x10^4 J$
    The work done by the car is $286/,200 J$ = $2.86x10^5 J$

### Problem 4: A $1.0 x 10^3$ kg elevator carries a maximum load of 800.0 kg. A constant frictional force of $4.0 x 10^3 N$ reduces the elevator’s upward motion. What minimum power, in kilowatts, must the motor deliver to lift the fully-loaded elevator at a constant speed of 3.0 m/s?

- (a) Player 1: Draw a reference frame
- (b) Player 2: Write a Net Force / Net work / Net Energy Equation
- (c) Player 3: determine the minimum power required by the motor (in kW)
  
  <details>
       The minimum power by the motor is $65 kW$ or $6.5x10^4 W$
