Mental Exercise for Troubleshooting:
- Imagine your webpage as a layered cake
- CSS is the frosting that decorates and styles the cake
- If no frosting appears, something is blocking its application

Diagnostic Questions for You:
1. When you view page source, is the CSS link present?
2. Are you using a Jekyll theme?
3. Have you run `jekyll build` recently?
4. Can you confirm your project structure looks like:
```
your-project/
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts/
│   └── default.html
└── assets/
    └── css/
        └── main.css
```

Would you be willing to confirm these details so we can precisely pinpoint where the rendering is breaking down?
