[Image](image.png) ### Vector addition
Adding vectors in a straight line requires placing the vectors tip-to-tail, then drawing a resultant vector.
The length and direction of the vectors do not change, so the vectors remain unchanged

<h1 id="vectors-advanced">Vectors, advanced</h1>
<p>Adding vectors that are not parallel allows trajectories and forces to be analyzed in multiple dimensions</p>

<h3 id="vectors-at-right-angles">Vectors at right angles</h3>
<p>When two vectors are added at right angles (90°) to each other, trigonometry can be used to calculate their resultant</p>

<h3 id="coordinate-planes">Coordinate planes</h3>
<p>Vectors can be visualized over an x-y coordinate plane so they are easier to analyze</p>

<h3 id="visualizing-triangles">Visualizing triangles</h3>
<p>Vectors that are not parallel to an x-y axis can be broken into components that are
Component - a vector parallel to the x- or y- axis
Component vectors make the original vector into a hypotenuse of a right triangle
Right triangles allow the use of the Pythagorean theorem to calculate vector lengths</p>

<h2 id="vector-resolution">Vector resolution</h2>
<p>The process of breaking a vector into its components is called vector resolution
Any vector can be written as the sum of its components</p>

<h3 id="components-in-trigonometry">Components in trigonometry</h3>
<p>Vector components can be calculated using trigonometry</p>

<p>Components can accumulate</p>

<h4 id="components-can-accumulate">Components can accumulate</h4>
<p>Vector components can be accumulated, and a final resultant found</p>

<h4 id="components-can-accumulate-1">Components can accumulate</h4>
<p>Adding y-components gives the y-component of the resultant. Doing the same for the x-components gives the x-component of the resultant.</p>

<h2 id="trig-functions-of-the-resultant-vector">Trig functions of the resultant vector</h2>
<p>Trigonometric functions can be used to determine the components</p>

<h3 id="computing-components">Computing components</h3>
<p>The angle of the resultant from the positive x-axis is the inverse tangent of its components</p>

<h2 id="example-1---vectors-of-velocity">Example 1 - Vectors of Velocity</h2>
<p>An airplane takes off at an angle of 4.60° above the horizon and climbs to cruising altitude at an average velocity of 114.3 km/h.
Sketch the scenario as described. Label as many components as possible.
What is the ground speed of the plane?
What is the plane’s rate of climb?
How long will the plane take to reach a cruising altitude of 2 000.0 m?
How far downrange will the plane be when it reaches 2 000.0 m?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="example-2---vectors-of-displacement">Example 2 - Vectors of Displacement</h2>
<p>A cargo ship leaves port heading slightly north of east. GPS shows an island that lies 201 km directly east. Shallow reefs require that ships be at least 3.55 km north of the island for safe passage.
Sketch the scenario as described. Label as many components as possible.
Calculate the ship’s displacement from port as it passes the island.
The navigator wants to set a heading for 1° north of east. Will this get them safely past the island’s reefs?</p>

<p>A curious thing about vector components and velocity
Time Dilation
The speed of light is constant, independent of any observer
To an observer on-board a spacecraft, light will bounce between two mirrors at a constant rate
To an observer on Earth, the mirrors are moving relative to the beam of light because the second mirror is no longer where it was when the light left the first
Because the light has now travelled a longer distance at a constant velocity, we explain this by saying time itself has changed.</p>

<p>Example 3
A model rocket reaches a maximum altitude of 214.6 m. Wind from the east pushed it 48.60 m from the launch pad. 
Calculate its displacement from the launch pad when it reaches its maximum altitude.
At what angle from the horizon would the rocket be visible at maximum altitude?
Sketch the situation, label as many vectors and elements as possible.</p>
