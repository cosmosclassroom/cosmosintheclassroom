## P1 Energy from Earth Systems
Today, energy grids represent a complex, dynamic network that transforms raw energy sources into the lifeblood of our technological society, connecting distant power generation facilities to the light switches and outlets in our homes and workplaces. These sophisticated systems are not merely passive conduits, but intelligent, responsive infrastructures that must continuously balance generation, transmission, and consumption across vast geographical regions, integrating an increasingly diverse array of energy sources from traditional fossil fuel power plants to intermittent renewable technologies like solar and wind, all while maintaining stability, reliability, and efficiency in a constantly shifting landscape of energy demand and supply.

## P5 Energy and Information in Waves
Electromagnetic waves are the invisible messengers that traverse the universe, carrying energy and information through space without requiring a physical medium, representing a fundamental mechanism by which nature communicates across immense distances and scales. From the radio waves that connect our global communication networks to the visible light that allows us to perceive the world around us, from the X-rays that peer inside the human body to the cosmic radiation that carries information about distant celestial events, these waves embody a profound principle of physical interaction that bridges the microscopic quantum realm with the vast astronomical expanses, governed by elegant mathematical principles that describe their propagation, interaction, and transformation.

## P3 Force, Impulse, and Collision Safety

At the intersection of physics and engineering, the study of force and momentum reveals the critical scientific principles that underpin automotive safety, transforming abstract physical concepts into life-saving technologies that protect human lives during the complex, high-stakes scenarios of vehicular collisions. By understanding how forces are transmitted, how momentum is conserved, and how energy is dissipated during an impact, engineers design crumple zones, airbag systems, seat belts, and structural reinforcements that can absorb and redistribute potentially catastrophic kinetic energy, turning the fundamental laws of classical mechanics into a sophisticated shield that mitigates the devastating potential of automotive accidents.

## P4 Celestial Mechanics

The study of meteors and orbital mechanics unveils the grand choreography of celestial bodies, revealing how gravitational interactions, celestial velocities, and cosmic trajectories govern the motion of objects from microscopic space debris to massive planetary systems. By exploring the complex mathematical models that describe how objects move through space, how gravitational fields interact, and how seemingly chaotic trajectories can be precisely predicted, we gain insights into the birth of planetary systems, the origins of meteors, the risks of space debris, and the fundamental principles that allow us to launch satellites, plan interplanetary missions, and understand the dynamic, ever-changing landscape of our solar system and beyond.
