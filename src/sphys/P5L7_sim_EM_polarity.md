# Simulation Lab | Field-Particle Interactions
#### Introduction

>Previous investigations have shown how microwaves interact with different materials on a macroscopic scale. We observed that water heats up significantly in a microwave oven, while materials like aluminum foil remain relatively cool. These observations raise a fundamental question: Why do different materials respond so differently to microwave radiation? To truly understand this, we need to delve into the sub-microscopic scale of **particles** and examine how microwaves interact with individual particles within these materials.

>Electromagnetic (EM) radiation, including microwaves, consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These fields can exert forces on charged particles, causing them to move. The way these *particles* respond to the oscillating fields determines how the material as a whole interacts with the radiation. In this simulation, we will shift our focus from the bulk behavior of materials to the behavior of individual particles within water, plastic (ethylene), and even an electron, as they are subjected to changing electric fields. By observing these particle-level interactions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind energy transfer and explain the macroscopic phenomena we've already observed. This exploration will help us connect the visible effects of microwaves to the underlying interactions occurring at the atomic and molecular level, providing a more complete picture of how EM radiation interacts with matter.

### Part I. Variables
Take a moment to familiarize with yourself with the simulation, which can be found here:

#### Change the Frequency of Flip
Try changing the **frequency-of-flip** pulldown. What changes about the electric field at high or low frequencies?

### Part II. Observations

#### Wave-Particle Interactions
The simulation allows you to investigate 3 types of particles. For each, use a combination of pictures and words to describe what you notice about (a) the force on the particle and (b) any changes in motion when the particles are exposed to changing electric fields. You likely want to enable *show-force-arrows*.

   **Table 1**. Summary of (a) forces and (b) changes in motion of particles exposed to changing electric fields.

   |Particle-Type|Force on Particle|Observed Motion|Interaction|
   |-:|-|-|-|
   |Water|<br><br><br><br>| | |
   |Ethylene (plastic)|<br> <br><br><br>| | |
   |Electron|<br><br><br><br>| | |

1. For each matter type, does the motion of the particle suggest that the microwave radiation is being **transmitted, reflected, or absorbed?** Indicate your results in Table 1 above. Summarize your **reasoning**.

#### Frequencies and Particles

2. How do different particles respond to the increased frequency/flipping of the electric field? Summarize your observations in Table 2 below.
   
   **Table 2**. Reactions of water and ethylene (plastic) to microwave radiation of different frequencies. 
   
   |Molecule|1.0 Hz|0.5 Hz|0.25 Hz| 0.125 Hz|
   |-:|-|-|-|-|
   |Water| | | |
   |Ethylene| | | |

Describe any patterns you observe in the data.

### Conclusions
3. For each matter type, use the questions to connect to the conclusions we reached about energy transfer at a macroscopic scale to the observations you made in the simulation. 
   - (a) What happens on a **macroscopic** scale to each type of matter when we expose it to EM radiation in the microwave oven?
   - (b) What **particle-scale** observations from the simulation help us explain this observation?
