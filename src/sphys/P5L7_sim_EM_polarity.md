# Simulation Lab | Field-Particle Interactions
#### Introduction

Electromagnetic radiation plays a primary role in various scientific and technological applications, from communication devices to medical imaging. Understanding how EM radiation interacts with different materials is essential for optimizing these technologies. This study delves into the interaction between EM radiation and matter through an interactive simulation tool, focusing on key materials like water and plastic.

### Part I. Variables
Take a moment to familiarize with yourself with the simulation, which can be found here:

#### Change the Frequency of Flip
Try changing the **frequency-of-flip** pulldown. What changes about the electric field at high or low frequencies?

### Part II. Observations

#### Forces on Particles
The simulation allows you to investigate 3 types of particles. For each, use a combination of pictures and words to describe what you notice about (a) the force on the particle and (b) any changes in motion when the particles are exposed to changing electric fields. You likely want to enable *show-force-arrows*.

   **Table 1**. Summary of (a) forces and (b) changes in motion of particles exposed to changing electric fields.

   |Particle-Type|Force on Particle|Change in Motion|Interaction|
   |-|-|-|-|
   |Water|<br><br>||
   |Ethylene (plastic)|<br> <br>|||
   |Electron|<br><br>|||

1. For each matter type, does the motion of the particle suggest that the microwave radiation is being **transmitted, reflected, or absorbed?** Indicate your results in Table 1 above.

#### Frequencies and Particles

2. How do different particles respond to the increased frequency/flipping of the electric field?
