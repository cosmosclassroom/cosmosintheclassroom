#   P5L4 | Wave Variables & Relationships

##   Part I: Wave Variables

|   Variable   |   Description   |   Picture/Visual Representation   |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   Amplitude   |   The maximum displacement of a wave from its resting position. It's how high the crests are or how low the troughs are.   |   A drawing of a wave with a clear indication of the distance from the midline to a crest or trough.   |
|   Frequency   |   The number of complete wave cycles that pass a point in one second.    |   A drawing showing several wave cycles, with a note that frequency is the number of these cycles per second.   |
|   Damping   |   The decrease in amplitude of a wave over time, usually due to energy loss. It's like how the waves die down.   |   A series of waves with decreasing amplitude over time.   |
|   Tension   |   The force pulling on a string or medium. It's how tight the string is pulled.   |   A drawing of a string with arrows indicating the tension force pulling in opposite directions.   |

##   Summarizing Results

As **frequency** increases, energy transferred, average vertical speed increase. Period and wavelength decrease. Amplitude, wave speed, damping, and tension remain unaffected.

As **amplitude** increases, energy transferred and average vertical speed increase. Period, wavelength, and wave speed remain unaffected.

As **tension** increases, wave speed and wavelength increase. Amplitude, damping, frequency, and period remain unaffected.

As **damping** increases, amplitude and energy transferred decrease. Frequency, period, wavelength, wave speed, and tension remain unaffected.
