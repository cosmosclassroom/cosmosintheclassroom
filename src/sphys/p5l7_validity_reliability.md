# Evaluating Scientific Claims: Assessing Validity and Reliability

When you encounter a scientific statement—something that claims to explain a phenomenon or process—it’d be wise to think carefully about it. It’s important to check if the statement is trustworthy. This involves looking at whether it’s *valid* and *reliable*.

**Validity: Does it Make Sense?**

A *valid* statement is one that is backed up by evidence and fits with what we already know. To see if a statement is valid, consider these points:

*   **Evidence:** Is there clear evidence to support the statement? Are the results easy to understand?
*   **Connection to What You Know:** Does the statement fit with what you’ve learned and experienced? If it doesn’t, why not?
*   **Fits with Science:** Does the statement agree with the basic laws and theories of science? If not, is there a good reason?

**Reliability: Can You Trust the Source?**

A *reliable* statement comes from a trustworthy source and can be checked by others. To see if a statement is reliable, consider these points:

*   **Expert Source:** Did the statement come from someone who knows a lot about the topic?
*   **Can It Be Checked?** Could someone else repeat the experiment or find the same information?
*   **Acknowledges Limitations:** Does the source admit if there are any problems with the information?
