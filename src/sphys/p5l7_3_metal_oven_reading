# Evaluating Information Checklist
> Teacher Key

| Indicator | Source 1 Rating | Source 2 Rating |
|-----------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Does the author back up their claims with evidence? | 3 | 3 |
| Are the claims consistent with your own experiences and understanding? | 3 | 3 |
| Are the claims consistent with science ideas from class? | 3 | 3 |
| Could you verify claims with classroom experiments? | 2 | 2 |
| Does the author cite credible sources? | 2 | 2 |
| Is the writer clear about certainty vs uncertainty? | 3 | 3 |

Justification of Ratings for Source 1:

**Validity**: I rated this as a 3 because the author provides explanations for their claims. For example, they explain how electrons move in metal and why sharp edges cause sparks. This aligns with what we've learned about charges and electromagnetic radiation in physics.   
**Validity**: The claims make sense to me. We've talked about how like charges repel, and I can visualize electrons moving around.
**Validity**: The physics concepts used, like electromagnetic radiation and electron behavior, are things we've covered in class.   
**Reliability**: I gave this a 2 because while their explanations sound good, it's hard to think of a simple experiment to really test all their claims in a classroom. We could maybe see sparks with foil, but measuring electron movement is beyond our lab capabilities.
**Reliability**: The author cites a source, which is good, but it's a blog on the company's website, not a scientific journal. That makes it less credible than a peer-reviewed study.   
**Reliability**: The author seems pretty confident in their claims, stating they've "thought through the science". They do point out a condition for safe use which is that the metal must be far from the walls.   

Justification of Ratings for Source 2:

**Validity**: This article also provides explanations, like how microwaves heat food by affecting water molecules and how metal reflects microwaves. The explanations make sense based on what I've learned in physics.   
**Validity**: The idea that microwaves affect water molecules is something we've discussed in biology and it connects to the physics of electromagnetic radiation.
**Validity**: This article uses physics concepts like radiation, electron behavior, and charge.   
**Reliability**: Similar to the first article, some of these claims would be hard to test in a school lab. We could observe sparks, but measuring the reflection of microwaves would be difficult.
**Reliability**: The article cites HowStuffWorks which is a website that tries to explain science to the general public. It's not a peer-reviewed scientific source.   
**Reliability**: The author acknowledges that the question was "harder to answer than we thought"  which shows some humility. They clearly explain how the sparks are formed and the danger.
