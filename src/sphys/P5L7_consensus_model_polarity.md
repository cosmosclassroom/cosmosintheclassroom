## Modeling 

### Components

**Electric Field:** Represent the direction and presence of the field with arrows or lines.

**Polar Molecules (Water)**: Show molecules with a clear dipole, indicating positive and negative ends.

**Forces on Water Molecules:** Indicate forces causing rotation or movement using arrows or directional indicators.

**Forces** are continuous due to the changing electric field.

**Balanced Charges in Plastic**: Demonstrate equal and opposite charges cancelling each other out.
- Molecule Type (Polar/Non-Polar): Clearly distinguish between water (polar) and plastic (non-polar).
---

### Interactions
**Water Interaction**
- The electric field exerts a force on the polar molecule's dipole, causing rotation.
  - Continuous forces lead to increased molecular motion, increasing kinetic energy.
**Plastic Interaction:**
- Non-polar molecules do not have dipoles and thus are not polarized by the electric field.
  - Balanced charges result in no net movement of charge carriers.

### Mechanisms

**Polar water molecules interact** with the alternating electric field.
  - The dipole aligns with the field, causing continuous force application.
  - This leads to rotational motion and increased molecular speed.
- **Higher kinetic energy translates to higher temperature** (heating).
Plastic Heating Mechanism:
**Non-polar plastic molecules lack dipoles** and cannot align with an electric field.
  - No net force is experienced by the molecule.
  - Charges are balanced, resulting in no movement or rotation.
    - Consequently, there's no transfer of thermal energy.
