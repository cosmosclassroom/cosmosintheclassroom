2. Polarity Observations
  I notice:
- There's a colored scale for electron density
- In Water, the O side has more electrons than the H
- The plastic has more balanced electrons
  
  I wonder:
  - If size of the molecules affects the microwave interactions
  - If charge affects the microwave interactions

   I/we predict that *polarity* affects how matter interacts with microwaves.

### Simulation Lab | Field-Particle Interactions

#### Variables
- ($\Delta$) particle type
- ($\Delta$) frequency-of-flip
- (m) direction of force
- (m) movement of particle

Changing the frequency-of-flip caused the direction of the electric field to change directions more quickly. Higher frequency means the field arrows flip more quickly.

**Table 1.** Summary of (a) forces and (b) changes in motion of particles exposed to changing electric fields 

| Particle-Type | Force on Particle | Observed Effect |Interaction|
|---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| Water |  Seemed to be pulled and pushed by the field.  The molecules moved noticeably. | Water molecules vibrated and rotated. Some seemed to be "pulled" towards the field. | Absorption - energy was gained|
| Ethylene (plastic) |  Hard to tell if there was much force. |  Very little movement observed.  The material seemed mostly unaffected. |Transmission - energy passed through|
| Electron |  Strong force!  The electron moved very quickly and erratically. | Electron was visibly pushed and pulled, moving rapidly in response to the field. |Absorption?|

Conclusions: I *think* "absorbed" means the energy from the field is used to make the material move. "Transmitted" means the field just goes through.  The electron didn't just absorb, it also changed direction. Hard to say.

#### Frequencies and Particles

**Table 2.** Reactions of water and ethylene (plastic) to microwave radiation of different frequencies. 

| Molecule | 1.0 Hz | 0.5 Hz | 0.25 Hz | 0.125 Hz |
| :-------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Water** | *Significant* rotation and vibration. Molecules appear to be moving rapidly and chaotically.  | *Moderate* rotation and vibration. Movement is noticeable but less intense than at 1.0 Hz. | *Slight* rotation and vibration. Movement is subtle and may require close observation. | *Very Slight* rotation and vibration. Movement is barely perceptible. |
| **Ethylene** | *Negligible* movement. Molecules remain largely stationary. | *Negligible* movement. Molecules remain largely stationary. | *Negligible* movement. Molecules remain largely stationary. | *Negligible* movement. Molecules remain largely stationary. |


### Conclusions

(a) Observations at the **macroscopic** scale:

**Water**: The water gets really hot, may boil or steam.
**Ethylene (Plastic)**: The plastic stays mostly the same. It might get a little warm, but not much.
**Electron**: The electron moves around really fast and changes direction a lot.
(b) What’s Happening at a Tiny Level?

Imagine everything is made of tiny building blocks. When microwaves shine on these building blocks, something happens:

*Water*: Water molecules are a bit like tiny magnets. Microwaves push and pull on these magnets, making them spin and wiggle really fast. This spinning and wiggling creates heat. The faster they spin and wiggle, the hotter the water gets. This is called energy transfer – the microwave is giving its energy to the water molecules.
Ethylene (Plastic): Plastic molecules don't react to microwaves very much. They don’t spin or wiggle much, so they don’t get much energy. That’s why the plastic stays cool. The microwave's energy just passes through it.
Electron: The electron is a tiny part of everything. It's moving really fast because the microwave is pushing it. This shows that the microwave is giving energy to the tiny parts of the material.
