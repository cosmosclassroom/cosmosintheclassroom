### Quiz: Uniform Circular Motion and Rotating Space Stations

**1. Artificial Gravity Calculation**

Given:
- Radius (r) of the rotating section = 25 meters
- Desired artificial gravity (\(a_g\)) to match Earth’s gravitational acceleration \(g \approx 9.80 m/s^2\)

Original formula: Centripetal force required for circular motion is provided by tension in a tether or normal reaction.

Rearranged and Solved Formula:
$$ T = m * (r \omega^2) $$

Since we want to match Earth's gravity, set $T = mg$:

Solve for angular velocity ($\omega$):
$$ r * \omega^2 = g $$
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{r}} $$

Substitute the given values:
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{9.80 \text{ m/s}^2}{25 \text{ m}}} $$
$$ \omega \approx 0.628 \text{ rad/s} $$

**Question: What should be the angular velocity (ω) of a rotating space station section with radius \( r=25m\) to produce an artificial gravity equivalent to Earth's gravitational accele

**2. Tangential Velocity Calculation**

Given:
- Radius (\(r\)) of the rotating section = 25 meters from Question 1.
- Angular velocity \(ω \approx 0.628 rad/s\), as calculated in question 1.

Original formula for tangential speed ($v_t$):
$$ v_t = r * \omega $$

Substitute values:
$$ v_t \approx (25 \text{ m}) * (0.628 \text{ rad/s})$$
$$ v_t \approx 15.70 \text{ m/s} $$

**Question: What is the required tangential velocity to match Earth’s gravity for a rotating space station section with radius \(r=25m\)?**
- A) 10.00 m/s
- B) 12.50 m/s
- C) 15.71 m/s
- D) 20.00 m/s

**Correct Answer: (C)**

**3. Centripetal Acceleration Calculation**

Given:
- Radius (\(r\)) of the rotating section = 25 meters from Question 1.
- Angular velocity \(ω \approx 0.628 rad/s\), as calculated in question 1.

Original formula for centripetal acceleration ($a_c$):
$$ a_c = r * \omega^2 $$

Substitute values:
$$ a_c \approx (25 \text{ m}) * (0.628 \text{ rad/s})^2 $$
$$ a_c \approx 9.80 \text{ m/s}^2$$

**Question: What is the required centripetal acceleration for an artificial gravity matching Earth's gravitational force at \(r=25m\)?**
- A) 5.00 m/s^2
- B) 7.50 m/s^2
- C) 9.80 m/s^2
- D) 12.50 m/s^2

**Correct Answer: (C)**

**4. Rotational Period Calculation**

Given:
- Radius (\(r\)) of the rotating section = 25 meters from Question 1.
- Angular velocity \(ω \approx 0.628 rad/s\), as calculated in question 1.

Original formula for period (T):
$$ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} $$

Substitute values:
$$ T \approx \frac{2\pi}{0.628 \text{ rad/s}}$$
$$ T \approx 10 \text{ s}$$

**Question: How long is the rotational cycle of a space station section with radius \(r=25m\) to simulate Earth’s gravity?**
- A) About 5 seconds
- B) Exactly 7 seconds
- C) Approximately 9.54 seconds
- D) Roughly 10 s

**Correct Answer: (D)**

**5. Rotational Kinetic Energy Calculation**

Given:
- Mass (\(m\)) of the rotating section = let’s use \( m=1000 kg \)
- Radius (\(r\)) from Question1, angular velocity \(ω \approx 0.628 rad/s\)

Original formula for rotational kinetic energy (K):
$$ K=\frac{1}{2} I\omega^2 $$

Moment of inertia (I) about the axis:
$$ I = mr^2 $$
- For a solid disc: $I = \frac{1}{2}mr^2$
  
Substitute values and solve for K:
$$ I \approx 0.5 * (1000 \text{ kg})(25 \text{ m})^2 $$
$$ I \approx 312,500 \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m}^2 $$

Now calculate the kinetic energy ($K$):
$$ K = 0.5 * 312,500 \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m}^2 * \omega^2 $$
$$ K = 0.5 * 312,500 \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m}^2 *(0.628 \text{ rad/s})^2 $$
$$ K \approx 61,250 \text{ J (Joules)} $$

**Question: What is the rotational kinetic energy of a rotating space station section with mass \(m=1000kg\), radius (\(r=25 m\)) and angular velocity \(ω\) approximately equal to Earth's gravity?**
- A) About 15.63 kJ
- B) Approximately 61.24 kJ
- C) Roughly 62,500 J (or about 68.03 kg*m^2/s^2)
- D) Nearly 25000 W

**Correct Answer: (B)**
