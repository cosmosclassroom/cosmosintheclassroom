# Problems

#### 1 Consider a 70.0 kg human standing on the surface of Earth  
   - a. Calculate the force of attraction between the two masses  
   - b. Calculate the resulting acceleration of the human toward Earth  
   - c. Calculate the resulting acceleration of the Earth toward the human  
   - 
#### 2. Consider a 70.0 kg human standing on the surface of Earth’s moon, Luna

   - a. Calculate the force of attraction between the two masses  
   - b. Calculate the resulting acceleration of the human toward Luna  
   - c. Calculate the resulting acceleration of Luna toward the human.  
 
#### 3. Calculate the weight of a 45.5 kg person in the following locations:  

   - a. On the surface of Earth  
   - b. 1.0x103 km above Earth  
   - c. On the “surface” of Saturn (there may well be no such thing)  
   - d. Compare your values for part (a) and (c ) above. Explain mathematically why they are so similar. Hint: masses, radii  
   - e. 1.0x103 km above Saturn  
   - f. Compare your value for part (b) and (e) above. Explain mathematically why they are so dissimilar.
    
#### 4. A spacecraft of mass 1850 kg holds a roughly circular orbit 2.00 radii above Earth’s surface.  

- a. Calculate the force of gravity experienced by the spacecraft  
- b. Determine the centripetal acceleration experienced by the spacecraft  
- c. Determine the velocity of the spacecraft  
   
#### 5. Suppose it is the year 1798 and the value of *G* has just been determined experimentally. Approximate the mass of Earth to three significant figures.  

#### 6.  A hypothetical planet has a radius of 2.0 times that of Earth, but has the same mass. What is the acceleration due to gravity near its surface?  

#### 7. A 958 kg lander probe touched down on the surface Europa (one of the moons of Jupiter) contains an accelerometer reading 1.98 m/s2. If the mass of Europa is 4.9 x 1022 kg: 

   1. Determine the force of attraction from Europa’s gravity  
   2. Calculate the circumference of the moon (in km)  
   
#### 8. Jupiter and Saturn are an average of 646,270,000 km apart. Calculate the (average) attractive force between the two bodies.
