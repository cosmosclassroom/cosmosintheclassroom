1. A piano emits frequencies that can range from a low of about 28 Hz to a high of about 4 200 Hz. Find the range of wavelengths in air attained by this instrument when the speed of sound in air is 340 m/s.  
2. The notes produced by a violin range in frequency from approximately 196 Hz to 2 637 Hz. Find the possible range of wavelengths in air produced by this instrument.  
3. The speed of all electromagnetic (EM) waves in empty space is 3.00 x 108 m/s. Calculate the wavelength of EM waves emitted at the following frequencies:  
   1. Radio waves; 88.0 MHz  
   2. Visible light; 6.0 x 108 MHz  
   3. X rays; 3.0 x 1012 MHz  
4. Red light emitted by a helium-neon laser has a wavelength of 633 nm in air and travels at the speed of light. Find the frequency of the laser light.   
5. Given a tuning fork's sound frequency of 256 Hz and a wavelength in air of 1.35 m,   
   1. Determine the speed of sound in air.  
   2. What would be the wavelength of this same sound in water, in which sound travels 1 500 m/s?  
6. Microwaves travel at the speed of light. When the frequency of the microwaves is 9.00 x 103 MHz, what is their wavelength?  
7. The smallest insects that a bat can detect are approximately the size of one wavelength of the soundwaves that a bat makes. What is the minimum frequency of sound waves required for a bat to detect an insect that is 0.57 cm long?  
8. A wave of amplitude 0.30 m interferes with a second wave of amplitude 0.20 m. What is the largest displacement that can occur at superposition?  
9. A string is rigidly attached to a post at one end. Several pulses of amplitude 0.15 m sent down the string are reflected at the post and travel back down the string without a loss of amplitude.  
   1. What is the amplitude at a point on the string where the maximum displacements of two pulses cross? What kind of interference is this?  
   2. How would the answers change if the same pulses were sent down a string whose end is free?
