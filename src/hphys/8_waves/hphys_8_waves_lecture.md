## Harmonics

Many objects oscillate:
- Springs
- Pendulums
- Tuning forks
- Electrons in atoms and molecules
- Molecules themselves

When an object vibrates back and forth over the same path, each oscillation taking the same amount of time, the motion is **periodic**.

---

## Simple Harmonic Motion

An oscillating object undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM) if the restoring force is proportional to the negative of its displacement (Hooke's Law)

![Spring motion](8_waves_slide4_img1.png)

$F = -kx$

where:
- $F$ = Spring force
- $k$ = Spring constant 
- $x$ = Displacement

---

## Properties of Oscillations

Oscillations are described by three properties:

- **Amplitude** ($A$): Maximum displacement from equilibrium
- **Period** ($T$): Time required for one complete cycle
- **Frequency** ($f$): Number of cycles per second

![Oscillation properties](8_waves_slide5_img2.png)

---

## Frequency and Period

The unit of frequency is the Hz or $s^{-1}$ and represents the number of cycles that occur each second.

- **Period** ($T$): Time required for one complete cycle
- **Frequency** ($f$): Number of cycles per second

![Frequency and Period](8_waves_slide6_img3.png)

---

## Frequency and Period

The period of oscillation for a mass $m$ on the end of a spring with spring constant $k$ is:

$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$

![Spring oscillation](8_waves_slide7_img4.png)

$T$ is the period of time for the mass to complete one cycle of movement.

![Spring oscillation example](8_waves_slide7_img5.png)

---

## Frequency and Period

Strange though it seems, the period is not dependent on amplitude.

![Amplitude independence](8_waves_slide8_img6.png)

Displacing a spring farther increases its velocity, and therefore the period is kept constant.

![Amplitude independence example](8_waves_slide8_img7.png)

---

## Transformation in SHM

During simple harmonic motion, the total energy of the system is conserved but is continually changing from kinetic to potential (and back).

![Energy transformation](8_waves_slide9_img8.png)

---

## Simple Pendulum

When friction is present, the motion is damped.

The maximum displacement of the pendulum decreases with time, and mechanical energy is eventually transformed into thermal energy (friction).

![Damped pendulum](8_waves_slide10_img9.png)

---

## Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum with length $l$ approximates SHM if the amplitude is small and friction is negligible (when displacement angles are below $15^\circ$).

For small amplitudes, its period of a pendulum is given by:

$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$

Note that the period depends only on length, not the mass or “bob”.

![Pendulum period](8_waves_slide11_img10.png)

This is the length of the pendulum.

## Wave Motions

A wave is the motion of a disturbance.

- Most waves require a medium, or material through which the disturbance travels.
- Waves that require a medium are called **mechanical waves**.
- Waves that do not require a medium are **electromagnetic waves**.

![Wave types](8_waves_slide13_img13.png)

---

## Particles in Waves

![Particles in waves](8_waves_slide14_img14.png)

Particles in the medium oscillate, tracing a returning path but not traveling with the wave.

As the wave passes, particles return to their original positions.

---

## Particles in Waves

![Particles in waves](8_waves_slide15_img15.png)

Particles in the medium oscillate, tracing a returning path but not traveling with the wave.

---

## Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

- **Transverse waves**: Particles move perpendicular to the wave motion.
  - Example: Dropping a pebble in a pond moves the water up and down, but the waves radiate outward laterally.
- **Longitudinal waves**: Particles move parallel to the wave motion.
  - Example: Compressing and releasing a spring.

---

## Creating Waves

Vibrating objects act as sources of waves that travel outward from the source.

Examples include waves in water or a string or cord.

![Wave creation](8_waves_slide17_img16.png)

---

## Wave Motions

The rate at which waves transfer energy depends on the amplitude at which the particles in the medium vibrate.

For mechanical waves, the energy transferred is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

When the amplitude of a wave is doubled, its energy increases by a factor of four.

---

## Creating Waves

A pulse is a single wave traveling through a medium.

## Creating Waves

Sine waves describe particles vibrating within harmonic motion.

![Sine wave](8_waves_slide21_img19.png)

- **Wavelength** ($\lambda$): Distance a wave travels in one cycle or the distance between crests or troughs on a wave.
- The trigonometric function $y = \sin x$ produces the curve when plotted.

---

## Modeling Waves

- **Crest**: The highest point above the equilibrium position.
- **Trough**: The lowest point below the equilibrium position.

![Wave modeling](8_waves_slide22_img20.png)

---

## Moving Waves

A traveling wave can be represented mathematically.

The velocity of a wave is its wavelength divided by its period:

$v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \lambda f$

---

## Interacting Waves

![Interference pattern](8_waves_slide24_img21.png)

The waves interact to form an interference pattern.

As waves move outward from their respective sources, they pass through one another.

---

## Colliding Waves

When waves come together, they do not collide as particles.

Because mechanical waves are not matter, only its displacement, two waves can occupy the same space at the same time.

**Superposition** is the combination of two overlapping waves at once.

---

## Colliding Waves

At each point in the wave, the displacements of the particles due to each wave are added.

The resulting sum is the displacement of the resultant wave.

- Displacements in the same direction produce **constructive interference**.
- Displacements in opposite directions produce **destructive interference**.

---

## Colliding Waves

Displacements in the same direction produce **constructive interference**.

![Constructive interference](8_waves_slide27_img22.png)

![Constructive interference example](8_waves_slide27_img23.png)

---

## Colliding Waves

Displacements in opposite directions produce **destructive interference**.

![Destructive interference](8_waves_slide28_img24.png)

![Destructive interference example](8_waves_slide28_img25.png)

Resultant displacement at each point is zero; pulses cancel each other out.

---

## After Collision

After the two pulses pass through each other, each pulse has the same shape it did before the waves met, and is still traveling in the same direction.

This is true for sound waves, water waves, light waves, and many others.

Waves maintain their own characteristics after interference.

---

## After Collision

![Collision aftermath](8_waves_slide30_img26.png)

![Collision aftermath example](8_waves_slide30_img27.png)

- **Constructive**
- **Destructive**
- **Partial**

---

## Reflection

When a pulse reaches a boundary, two changes can occur:

- If it is a **free boundary**, the wave reflects, changing direction and maintaining its amplitude and orientation.

![Free boundary reflection](8_waves_slide31_img28.png)

---

## Reflection

When a pulse reaches a boundary, two changes can occur:

- If it is a **fixed boundary**, the wave reflects, changing direction and is also inverted.

![Fixed boundary reflection](8_waves_slide32_img29.png)

---

## Standing Waves

If a medium is vibrated at exactly the right frequency, a standing wave can be formed.

A standing wave is a wave that appears to stand motionless due to alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference.

- **Nodes**: Points of complete destructive interference ($\text{displacement} = 0$).
- **Antinodes**: Points of largest amplitude, caused by perfectly aligned constructive interference.

- **Antinodes**: Points of largest amplitude, caused by perfectly aligned constructive interference.

![Standing wave](8_waves_slide34_img30.png)

Only certain frequencies (and therefore wavelengths) produce standing waves.

## Standing Waves

Only certain frequencies (and therefore wavelengths) produce standing waves.

![Standing wave frequencies](8_waves_slide35_img31.png)

For any given wave of period $T$, four standing waves can exist:

## Example 2 | Suspension on a car

The body of a $1275 \, \text{kg}$ car is supported on a frame by four springs. Two people riding in the car have a combined mass of $153 \, \text{kg}$. When driven over a pothole in the road, the frame vibrates with a period of $0.840 \, \text{s}$. For the first few seconds, the vibration approximates SHM. Find the spring constant of the suspension springs.

## Example 3 | A piano string

A piano string tuned to middle C vibrates with a frequency of $262 \, \text{Hz}$. Assuming the speed of sound in air is $343 \, \text{m/s}$, find the wavelength of the sound waves produced by the string.
