# Problems

1. A load of 45 N attached to a spring that is hanging vertically stretches the spring 14 cm. What is the spring constant?  
2. A tower contains a pendulum that extends from the ceiling to very near the floor.   
   1. If the period of the pendulum is 12 s, how tall is the tower?  
   2. What would be the height of the tower if the period of the pendulum was doubled?  
3. Calculate the period and frequency of a 3.500 m long pendulum at the following locations:  
   1. The North Pole; ag \= 9.832 m/s2  
   2. Luna; ag \= 1.625 m/s2  
   3. Saturn; ag \= 11.20 m/s2  
4. The reading on a metronome indicates the number of oscillations per minute. What are the frequency and period of the metronome’s vibration if the metronome is set at 180?  
5. A child swings on a playground swing with a 2.5 m long chain.  
   1. What is the period of the child’s motion?  
   2. What is the frequency of the vibration?  
6. A 0.75 kg mass is attached to a vertical spring and stretches the spring 30.0 cm. It is then placed on a horizontal surface and set vibrating. What is the period of the vibration?
